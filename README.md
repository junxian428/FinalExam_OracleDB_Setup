FinalExam_OracleDB_Setup (Oracle Form Developer) 

If your PATH environment variable is longer than ~1024 characters, you can run into problems â€” especially with older Oracle tools like Forms Developer (and also some older Java-based apps) because:

Old Windows APIs had a MAX_PATH limit of 1024 or 2048 characters.

Some legacy installers/tools still assume that limit.

When PATH is too long, parts of it can be truncated or ignored, and required bin folders may not be found.
